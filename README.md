# CT_Scan

## Description
This project focuses on the reconstruction of biological specimens from projection data, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-ray images. A commonly used reconstruction technique is the transform method, with Filtered Back Projection (FBP) being particularly popular due to its speed and ease of implementation. However, FBP often results in low-quality, blurred images, especially when handling incomplete or noisy datasets.

## The primary goals of this project are:

- To explore and document various reconstruction methods for biological specimens.
- To develop advanced computational techniques that produce high-quality reconstructed images with enhanced clarity and accuracy.
- The image data for this project is primarily generated and processed using C++.

## How to run the code?
- Regarding the output image, you just need to put Display.h and html.dat from the main directory into the same directory as the program.
- If the program contains line_functions, just put the line_function.h files in the line_function folder in the same directory as the program.
