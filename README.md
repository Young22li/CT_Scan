Biospecimen Reconstruction: Improving Image Clarity and Accuracy
This project focuses on the reconstruction of biological specimens from projection data, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-ray images. A commonly used reconstruction technique is the transform method, with Filtered Back Projection (FBP) being particularly popular due to its speed and ease of implementation. However, FBP often results in low-quality, blurred images, especially when handling incomplete or noisy datasets.

The primary goals of this project are:

To explore and document various reconstruction methods for biological specimens.
To develop advanced computational techniques that produce high-quality reconstructed images with enhanced clarity and accuracy.
The image data for this project is primarily generated and processed using C++.
